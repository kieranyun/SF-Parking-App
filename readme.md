This is going to be a project where I make an app that gets data from a server that tracks where you park.

There will be an API that gets a location and returns any parking restrictions. The API gets data from SF street sweeping data: https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Sweeping-Schedule/yhqp-riqs/about_data
